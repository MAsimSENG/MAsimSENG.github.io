**Project description:** Devising effective algorithms to classify emotion is a preliminary step toward effective communication between robots and humans. In this work different machine learning methods are applied on the RAVDESS dataset to identify which emotion is being expressed by a human actor in an audio recording in the form of speech or song.  

### 1. Data processing and feature extraction

  Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) features were extracted from 3-second time series representation of the audio files. MFCCs are a common feature representation used for audio classification purposes. The MFCCs provide a data representation that is sensitive in a way similar to how human perceive sound

  The PCA algorithm (Principal component analysis) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that transforms data into a lesser dimensional space while still preserving the information represented by the original data. The standardization of data is important before PCA because the PCA gives more importance to variables with high variance. This was especially relevant for this study because the values of the mfcc varied depending on the emotion and type of audio file (speech vs sung).

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
